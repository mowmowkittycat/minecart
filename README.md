## minecart
this is a plugin package manager for minecraft servers :)

## NOTE: 
### for now, please consider this project abandoned
so i've abandoned this project somewhat because botting downloads is actually against spigot TOS or smth
even though this is technically a valid use case, it doesn't 100% fall under an exception and i'm probably not important enough to ask for an exception

i may finish whatever's left for bukkit and remove spigot completely, or i'll have all the download links open in headless chromium or something
however, if i choose to use chromium, the project will become insanely heavy

idk we'll see
